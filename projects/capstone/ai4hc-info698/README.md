Designed the showcase poster for a 6-person AI-for-Healthcare capstone team, then wrote the Python pipeline that rendered it into a 48x36 in, print-ready PDF matching the on-screen version exactly.

## What I built

**The poster: one visual for the whole system.** Took Abhiram Varma Nandimandalam's initial HTML draft ([isjustabhi/AI4HC](https://github.com/isjustabhi/AI4HC)) and developed it into the team's final capstone poster, distilling the entire product (the RAG pipeline, the HeyGen avatar integration, the quiz engine, the learner flow) into a single layout a viewer could read in under a minute. Two theme variants: light for the project slide demo, dark for the printed banner.

**The print pipeline.** Wrote [`scripts/export_poster.py`](./scripts/export_poster.py), a Python pipeline that renders the poster HTML in headless Chrome at 4608x3456 px, screenshots it, and embeds the PNG losslessly into a 48x36 in PDF with print-shop metadata (title, author, subject, keywords). The team printed straight from this PDF for the iShowcase event, and the physical poster matched the on-screen render exactly.

**Avatar source footage.** Recorded the 1-minute source clip used for the team's HeyGen avatar and handed it to the project coordinator, who wired the HeyGen integration.

## What I didn't build

The team's product, the Rural Health Kiosk (an AI-powered healthcare access system for underserved rural communities), is a .NET 8 web app with a RAG-backed chat tutor over a medical knowledge base, a HeyGen streaming avatar, and a multiple-choice quiz engine, all built by the engineering members of the team. My contribution was the poster, the print pipeline, and the avatar source footage; the codebase isn't mine.

<summary>Rebuild the print PDF</summary>

Requires Python 3.9+, Chrome or Chromium, and `img2pdf`.

```bash
pip3 install img2pdf
python3 scripts/export_poster.py
```

Renders the HTML in headless Chrome at 4608x3456 px, screenshots it, then embeds the PNG losslessly into a 48x36 in PDF. Runtime is about 10 seconds. Flags: `--out <path>` for a custom filename, `--keep-png` to keep the intermediate PNG.

# Data  

- **Family-level dataset**: Contains 1,087 rows. Binary (0/1) presence/absence data for various sexually selected traits at the family level, each linked to a phylum.  
- **Evolutionary rates dataset**: Contains 84 rows. Continuous values estimating the origin rates of sexually selected traits at the phylum level, based on discrete maximum likelihood analyses.

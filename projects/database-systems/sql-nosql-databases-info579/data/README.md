## Business Intelligence Project Context

### Hospital Performance & Patient Outcome Analytics System

This project implements a comprehensive **Hospital Performance & Patient Outcome Analytics System** focusing on five key business objectives:

#### 1. **Increase Profitability**
- Analyze procedure outcomes vs. costs to identify cost-ineffective treatments
- Track high-cost patients and claim patterns for financial risk management
- **Key Finding**: Patients with highest healthcare expenses identified for targeted cost management

#### 2. **Improve Clinical Quality** 
- Monitor condition management effectiveness through visit frequency analysis
- Track 14-day post-procedure follow-up rates as quality indicators
- **Key Finding**: Most common conditions are respiratory infections and cardiometabolic risk factors

#### 3. **Optimize Provider Utilization**
- Assess provider performance through encounter volume and patient outcomes
- Identify workload imbalances and capacity underutilization
- **Key Finding**: Severe workload imbalance detected - top provider handled 3,000+ encounters while others <2,000

#### 4. **Reduce Readmissions**
- Flag high-risk patients with frequent emergency visits (≥3 ER visits)
- Monitor patient health trajectories and readmission patterns
- **Key Finding**: Emergency and inpatient encounters have significantly higher mortality rates

#### 5. **Identify Care Strategic Expansion**
- Analyze procedure frequency to guide service line investments
- Evaluate specialty utilization for resource allocation decisions
- **Key Finding**: Most frequent procedures are non-surgical interventions (medications, evaluations, therapies)

## Critical Database Relationships Discovered

### **Many-to-Many Relationships Verified**
- **Patient ↔ Conditions**: 1,152 unique patients with 8,000+ condition records
- **Patient ↔ Procedures**: 1,165 unique patients with 15,000+ procedure records
- **Conditions**: 129 unique condition codes affecting multiple patients
- **Procedures**: 137 unique procedure codes across multiple patients

### **Data Quality Insights**
- **Encounter Coverage**: 100% of encounters have assigned providers (excellent data integrity)
- **Missing Observations**: 10.13% of observation records have unmatched encounter IDs
- **Patient Mortality**: Death rate analysis by encounter class reveals quality indicators

## Real-World Healthcare Analytics Applications

### **Provider Performance Metrics**
```sql
-- Example: Provider utilization analysis
SELECT provider_specialty, COUNT(*) AS total_procedures
FROM provider pr 
LEFT JOIN encounter e ON pr.provider_id = e.provider_id
LEFT JOIN procedures pc ON e.encounter_id = pc.encounter_id
GROUP BY provider_specialty
ORDER BY total_procedures DESC;
```

### **Patient Risk Stratification**
```sql
-- Example: High-risk emergency patients
SELECT patient_id, COUNT(*) AS er_visits
FROM encounter 
WHERE encounter_class = 'emergency'
GROUP BY patient_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```

### **Clinical Quality Indicators**
```sql
-- Example: 14-day follow-up rates
SELECT procedure_code, 
       COUNT(*) AS total_procedures,
       SUM(has_followup_14d) AS with_followup,
       ROUND(100 * SUM(has_followup_14d) / COUNT(*), 2) AS followup_rate
FROM procedure_followup_analysis
GROUP BY procedure_code;
```
